## Working Papers

### [Readers vs Owner? What Drives Media Slant on China during the Sino-U.S. Trade Conflict](http://wumengecon.github.io/files/jmp.pdf)(Job Market Paper)

### Abstract: 

In the past two years, the Sino-US relation has been through a volatile period due to trade conflicts. At the same time, there is extensive heterogeneity in the coverage on China by the U.S. media, both in terms of intensity and topics. What drives media attention on China as the U.S.’s diplomatic relation with her changes? In this paper, I use President Donald Trump's tweets as indicators of diplomatic event, and I use the coverage by local daily newspapers to separate the effects from the demand (the readers’) side and the supply (the owner’s) side. I find that on average, a local newspaper’s coverage on human rights and ideological issues of China responded to the President’s tweets, and the response is driven by its owner’s political leaning. The more democratic-leaning (republican-leaning) its owner is, the more a paper covered human rights and ideological issues when Sino-US relationship got better (worse). On the other hand, such pattern barely true for the coverage on the trade conflict itself. In contrast, the political preference of newspapers’ readers has little consistent effect. My study sheds light on the potential concerns of media independence in the United States when it comes to coverage on foreign countries.

### Checks and Balances: Media Criticism in China (polished version available soon)

### Abstract:

I study how political competition among provincial officials affects media criticism in China. I collect news reports by local mouthpiece outlets that criticize the provincial governments from 2004 to 2017. By exploiting the randomness of the pairing of the provincial governor and sectary, I prove that higher competition induces more criticism. I find that if a pair is assigned such that their promotion periods overlap, then during the overlapped period it is more likely to observe critical reports. I construct a model to illustrate how competition can be generated by promotion pressure. Intuitively, when both officials go through promotion examination, the economic signal from each individual cannot be observed separately, and media coverage serves as an additional signal to reveal their types.

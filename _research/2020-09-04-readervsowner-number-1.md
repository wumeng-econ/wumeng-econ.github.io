Abstract: 
During 2018 and 2019, Sino-US relations have experienced a frequent volatility mainly due to trade conflicts. At the same time on United States media, not only stories about Sino-US trade conflicts and North Korea denuclearization negotiation have been covered, but also topics related to Chinese ideology, human rights and its other international influences. What drives media' attention on China in response to foreign relations changes? In this paper, I use President Donald J. Trump's twitter to define diplomatic changes and use local daily newspapers to separate the effects from demand side and supply side. I find that the change of coverage of Chinese ideological issues in response to Trump's tweets is driven by owner's political identity, while the responsive coverage of China about trade conflict is not explained by owner's political identity. Specifically, after Trump's tweets mentioned "President Xi" to express his positive attitude towards China, compared with the pre-tweet period, the more democratic its  owner is, the more a newspaper covered China's ideology. Meanwhile, after Trump's tweets expressed a negative attitude against China, the more republican its owner is, the more a paper covered China's ideology. By contrast, little consistent and robust evidence is found on the effect of readers' preference.
